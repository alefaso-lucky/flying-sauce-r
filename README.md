üçù Flying-Sauce-r: Pasta Delivery Full Stack Web App
=====================================================

>üöÄ A feature-rich, full-stack web application that serves as **pasta delivery platform** built with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Developed during a **3-month university project** by a team of 4, it demonstrates skills in **web development**, **database integration**, and **responsive UI/UX design**. Includes responsive design, user authentication, cart/order management, and admin controls.

* * *

üìå Overview
-----------

**Flying-Sauce-r** is a complete web-based **pasta delivery system**, designed with a modular approach to simulate a real-world food ordering service. Built using **vanilla PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, it features **responsive design**, **dynamic cart functionality**, **secure user login/registration**, and an **order summary system**, all backed by a PostgreSQL database.

### üìÅ Project Highlights

* üë§ **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and access to a personal restricted area.
    
* üçù **Customizable Pasta Builder**: Create and customize your own pasta dish with a modular builder.
    
* üì¶ **Order Management**: Seamless order finalization within a protected area.
    
* üì± **Responsive Design**: Optimized for multiple browsers and devices.
    
* üõ†Ô∏è **Database Integration**: Full CRUD operations for users, orders, and products.

* * *

üåç Language Note
----------------

All **code comments and internal documentation** are written in **Italian**, as the project was developed during a group exam at the **University of Salerno (Italy)**.

Despite this, the **codebase follows international best practices**, with clear method names and class structures that make it easily understandable for global developers and recruiters.
